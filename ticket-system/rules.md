# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Ticket Rules (EN)

## 1. Interaction and resistance:

1. We treat all customers and users of our service with respect and professionalism.
2. We do not tolerate discriminatory, offensive, or abusive behavior towards other customers or users of our service.
3. We reserve the right to remove any users who engage in these behaviors from our Service.

## 2. Cooperativeness:

1. We strive to help every customer and user of our service as much as possible.
2. We will do our best to answer and solve questions and problems quickly and efficiently.
3. We expect a helpful and solution-oriented way of working, on the other hand we are forced to terminate the support relationship with immediate effect.
4. We reserve the right, however, to prioritize requests or issues based on urgency or complexity.

_Please always remember that you are not the only customer who needs help!_
{% endhint %}

## 3. Quick response time:

1. We strive to respond to all support tickets within 24 hours.
2. During peak times or for particularly complex requests, it may take longer to respond, depending on the nature of the request.

## 4. Cooperativeness:

1. We expect a cooperative attitude from our customers and users in resolving any issues or requests.
2. We ask that all relevant information be provided to help us diagnose and resolve problems.

## 5. Conditions:

1. We assume that your server is fully configured correctly, from the FiveM artifact (internal game files), the database (working MySQL instance), the framework (e.g. ESX) to scripting requirements such as esx\_status, food and drink management.
2. As a reference, we always use the preconfigured default server provided by the framework in the version you are using. If the submitted error does not occur, it means that a resource you changed or added is causing the error. In this case, we will help you find the cause, but it is your server and your responsibility. We are not obligated to fix the resources you changed. Out of kindness, we will do our best to help you find a solution in a competent and cooperative approach, but only as long as our team's time allows.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We would like to point out that our support service is a voluntary service. We are not obligated to handle or fix server data or other technical problems that are not caused by us. However, we will do our best to help solve problems if it is within our capabilities.
{% endhint %}

#### We hope that these rules clarify how our support service works and what we expect from our customers and users. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.
