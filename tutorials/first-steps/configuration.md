{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not know your primary IPv4 address, ask your hoster or use a [detection service](https://www.wieistmeineip.de/).
{% endhint %}

#### 3. Configure the ViorityCore&#x20;

&#x20;   3.1 Configure **all** important initial entries for your specific server!!

&#x20;   3.2 Change the `GetIdentifier` Function! Check your Database!!!\


![You will need the Steam Identifier](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

![You will need the Rockstar License](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Attention! Special case!
{% endhint %}

![In this special case, it is important to see what is in the identifier column.&#x20;
So in this case: You will need the Steam Identifier](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
You will find the identifiers in the "users" table in your database!
{% endhint %}

&#x20;   3.3 Adjust the entries under `SQL_Tables`, if available, according to your database!\
&#x20;   3.4 Customise the rest of ViorityCore to customize the product to your server.\
&#x20;   3.5 _<mark style="color:blue;">**OPTIONAL**</mark>_ Activate the `DebugMode` to identifier an error or just for analysis!\
&#x20;   3.6 _<mark style="color:blue;">**SPECIFIC**</mark>_** Read the Docs of your Multi-Char System when the Identifier ist modified!!!**

#### 4. Insert the SQL&#x20;

&#x20;   4.1 Copy the SQL, if available, in your clipboard.\
&#x20;   4.2 Insert the Data in your Database. \
&#x20;   4.3 Please make sure that all tables/columns have been created correctly.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is not always necessary to change anything in the database.
{% endhint %}

#### 4.4 Example for phpMyAdmin

&#x20;   4.4.1 Go to your phpMyAdmin Dashboard page. Make sure you have installed it successfully.\
&#x20;   4.4.2 Now click on the `SQL` Button in the top tab bar.

![The SQL Button in the top tab bar in phpMyAdmin.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

&#x20;   4.4.3 Now you will see an input field into which you copy the desired SQL.\
&#x20;   4.4.4 After that click on the `OK` button to execute the changes.
