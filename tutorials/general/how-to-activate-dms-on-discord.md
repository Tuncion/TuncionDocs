> * Request Product Information
> * Get Checkout Information (Successful Purchase etc.)

#### 1. Activate discord messages on our server

&#x20;   1.1 Right-Click on [our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/323HfHyGW4).\
&#x20;   1.2 Click on **Privacy Settings**.\
&#x20;   1.3 Make sure that the setting **Direct Messages** is **activated**.\
